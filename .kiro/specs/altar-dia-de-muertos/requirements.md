# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Altar is a web application that honors the Mexican tradition of Día de Muertos by allowing users to create digital altars (ofrendas) for their loved ones. Users upload a photo of a deceased person, describe their favorite foods, and receive an AI-generated image of a traditional altar featuring the photo and described foods. The application combines cultural tradition with modern AI technology to create meaningful digital memorials.
